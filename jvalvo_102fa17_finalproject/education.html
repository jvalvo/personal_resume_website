        <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I skipped pre-kindergarten as well as first grade, and I have been
            testing at college level since eight years old on end-of-school-year
            Iowa tests.  In those tests, I was also in the upper ninetieth
            percentile of those at my grade level.</p>

            <p>I was homeschooled since third grade to allow myself to learn
                at the faster speed I needed.  I graduated high school at
                sixteen years old.</p>
            <p>I tested into the Technical College of the Lowcountry for dual
                enrollment at fourteen years old.  At sixteen, I was accepted
                into the University of South Carolina Beaufort, where I am currently
                in computational science studies.  Of all college
                level courses I have taken currently, I have gotten all A's and one B.</p>
            <p>At USCB, I have taken classes such as MATLAB, Java, calculus I through III,
                general applications programming, technical writing, introduction to computer
                security, introduction to computational science, public communications,
                western civilization through the 17th century, studio arts for non majors, and
                human biology.  From taking dual enrollment at TCL, I have taken introduction to
                computer concepts, accounting 1 and 2, micro and macroeconomics, English 1 and 2,
            intermediate algebra, introduction to geography, and general psychology.</p>
            <p>I have now learned a general understanding of computational science
                from my introduction class as well as programming in MATLAB, Java, HTML, CSS,
                and some JavaScript (this site was created by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!),
                and I am excited to learn more and start on more computer-oriented
                projects of his own.</p>
