        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <h4>Singing and music</h4>
        <p>I have been singing nearly all my life.  I was in a choir at eight
            years old and have performed in churches and a restaurant.  I currently
            take an interest in a cappella music, and I can often be found exercising this
            hobby in the shower.</p>
        <p>I have been taking guitar lessons for over a year and have performed at
            a church with guitar as well.</p>
        <h4>Travel</h4>
        <p>I love to travel.  From places as close as Florida through places
            as far as Italy, I have enjoyed every moment of experiencing new
            places, people, and things.  I have been to Italy, Spain, France,
            Canada, and many more locations within the United States!</p>
        <h4>Video Games</h4>
        <p>I love games, especially as a social activity.  I am fascinated
            by game design, art style, color schemes, etc.  I recently attended
            an event at my university in which game developer Thomas Brush spoke about
            his creation of Pinstripe and the then upcoming Once Upon a Coma.  Neat stuff!</p>
        <h4>Water parks, pools, beaches, etc</h4>
        <p>Living on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, I have been around water
            most of my life.  My favorite animal is an otter, and I like to think
            I am similar to one when it comes to my love for being in water.</p>
